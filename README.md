# 🚢 Titanic Survival EDA

## 📌 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Kaggle Titanic dataset** to uncover survival patterns based on passenger demographics, travel class, and family structures.

## 🔍 Key Steps

* Data cleaning (missing values, drop Cabin, encoding)
* Descriptive stats & visualizations
* Survival analysis by **gender, class, age groups, embarkation point**
* Feature engineering: **FamilySize, Title, Age/Fare bins**
* Outlier detection using boxplots & IQR

## 🎯 Key Insights

1. Women and children had higher survival rates.
2. First-class passengers survived more than third-class.
3. Small families (2–4 members) had better odds.
4. Titles (Mr, Miss, Master, etc.) were predictive.
5. Higher fare → higher survival probability.

👉 This one is short, professional, and GitHub-friendly.

Do you want me to also make a **one-liner GitHub repo tagline** (for the small description field under the repo name)?
